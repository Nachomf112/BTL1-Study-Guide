# What is the BTL1 (Blue Team Level 1) Certification?

The **Blue Team Level 1 (BTL1)** certification is an entry-level, **hands-on cybersecurity certification** focused on **defensive security operations**. It is designed to validate the **practical skills required for junior Blue Team and SOC roles**, rather than theoretical knowledge or multiple-choice exams.

BTL1 is offered by **Security Blue Team**, an organization specialized in Blue Team training and certifications.

## 🛡️ Blue Team Focus

BTL1 is clearly positioned on the **Blue Team side** of cybersecurity:

- **Blue Team**: Detection, monitoring, analysis, and response
- **Red Team**: Attack simulation and exploitation (not the focus of BTL1)

The certification emphasizes **defensive thinking**, incident investigation, and operational workflows used in real environments.
