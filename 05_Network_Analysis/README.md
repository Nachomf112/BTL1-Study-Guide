# Network Analysis

Network analysis is a core skill for Blue Team and SOC analysts. By inspecting network traffic, analysts can identify malicious behavior, validate alerts, and reconstruct attacker activity.

This module focuses on **practical network analysis for detection and investigation**, not network engineering or offensive exploitation.

## 🎯 Objectives of Network Analysis in SOC

The main objectives of network analysis are:

- Detect suspicious or malicious communications
- Identify command-and-control (C2) behavior
- Validate SIEM or IDS alerts
- Support incident investigation and scoping
- Provide evidence for escalation or containment

---

## 🧠 SOC Analyst Perspective

Effective network analysis requires:

- Understanding baseline network behavior
- Recognizing anomalies and patterns
- Correlating network data with endpoint and log evidence
- Focusing on impact and relevance
