# Traffic Analysis and Anomaly Detection

Analyzing network traffic allows SOC analysts to identify deviations from normal behavior that may indicate malicious activity.

---

## 🔍 What Is an Anomaly?

An anomaly is behavior that deviates from the established baseline, such as:

- Unusual outbound connections
- Unexpected protocols or ports
- Abnormal data volumes
- Connections to unknown geolocations

---

## 🧠 Context Is Critical

Not all anomalies are malicious. Analysts must consider:

- Time of day
- User behavior
- Business operations
- Known maintenance or changes

---

## 📌 Key Takeaway

Anomalies are **investigation triggers**, not conclusions.
