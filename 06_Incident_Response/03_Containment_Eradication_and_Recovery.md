# Containment, Eradication, and Recovery

Once an incident is confirmed, SOC teams must act to **limit damage and restore operations**.

---

## 🛑 Containment

Containment actions may include:

- Isolating affected systems
- Blocking malicious IPs or domains
- Disabling compromised accounts

The goal is to **stop the threat from spreading**.

---

## 🧹 Eradication

Eradication focuses on:

- Removing malware or persistence mechanisms
- Closing exploited vulnerabilities
- Ensuring attacker access is eliminated

---

## 🔄 Recovery

Recovery includes:

- Restoring systems from clean backups
- Monitoring for re-infection
- Validating normal operations

---

## 📌 Key Takeaway

Response actions must be **controlled, documented, and validated**.
