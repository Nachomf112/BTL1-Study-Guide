2. Preserve and collect data
3. Analyze relevant artifacts
4. Correlate findings
5. Draw evidence-based conclusions
6. Document results clearly

## 📝 Importance of Documentation

Good forensic documentation should:

- Reference specific evidence
- Explain reasoning and conclusions
- Support future review or escalation

Documentation is often as important as analysis itself.
