# Disk Forensics Basics

Disk forensics involves the analysis of **persistent storage** to identify evidence of malicious activity or system misuse.

In SOC environments, disk forensics is often used to **validate alerts** and investigate suspected compromise.

---

## 🎯 Objectives of Disk Forensics

- Identify suspicious files or modifications
- Detect persistence mechanisms
- Reconstruct file system activity
- Support incident timelines

---

## 🔍 Common Disk Artifacts

SOC analysts commonly examine:

- File creation, modification, and access times
- Executable files and scripts
- User directories and downloads
- Startup and persistence locations
- Log files stored on disk

---

## 🧠 Practical Considerations

- Focus on relevant timeframes
- Correlate disk artifacts with alerts and logs
- Avoid unnecessary deep analysis

Disk forensics should be **targeted and contextual**.

---

## 📌 Key Takeaway

Disk forensics provides **historical evidence** that supports or refutes security hypotheses.
