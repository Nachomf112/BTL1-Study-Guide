# Threat Intelligence Sources and Evaluation

Not all Threat Intelligence sources provide the same value. SOC analysts must evaluate **credibility, relevance, and timeliness** before acting on intelligence.

---

## 🌐 Common Threat Intelligence Sources

SOC teams typically use:

- Open-source intelligence (OSINT)
- Vendor-provided feeds
- Government and CERT advisories
- Community-driven platforms

Each source has strengths and limitations.

---

## 🧠 Evaluating Intelligence Quality

Key evaluation criteria:

- Source reputation
- Evidence transparency
- Update frequency
- Relevance to the organization
- Historical accuracy

Blind trust in feeds increases false positives.

---

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls

- Over-reliance on a single source
- Acting on outdated intelligence
- Ignoring business or environmental context
- Treating all indicators as equally important

---

## 📌 Key Takeaway

Effective Threat Intelligence consumption requires **critical thinking**, not just access to data.
