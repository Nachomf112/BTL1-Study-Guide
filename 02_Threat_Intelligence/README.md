# Threat Intelligence

**Threat Intelligence (TI)** is a fundamental capability for Blue Team and SOC operations. It enables analysts to **understand adversaries, techniques, and indicators**, providing context that improves detection, investigation, and response decisions.

This module introduces the **practical use of Threat Intelligence** in day-to-day SOC workflows, with a focus on **actionable intelligence**, not theory.

## 🎯 Objectives of Threat Intelligence

The primary objectives of Threat Intelligence within a SOC are:

- Provide context to alerts and indicators
- Support investigation and triage decisions
- Identify known malicious infrastructure or behavior
- Reduce false positives
- Improve detection and response efficiency

Threat Intelligence should always aim to be **relevant, timely, and actionable**.

## 🧠 Types of Threat Intelligence

Threat Intelligence is commonly categorized into four levels:

### 1️⃣ Strategic Intelligence
- High-level trends and threat landscape overview
- Used by management and leadership
- Focused on risk awareness and decision-making

### 2️⃣ Tactical Intelligence
- Adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)
- Often mapped to frameworks such as MITRE ATT&CK
- Useful for detection engineering and threat hunting

### 3️⃣ Operational Intelligence
- Information about specific campaigns or threat actors
- Timing, targets, and objectives
- Helps anticipate potential attacks

### 4️⃣ Technical Intelligence
- Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) such as:
  - IP addresses
  - Domains
  - URLs
  - File hashes

This is the most commonly used level in SOC investigations.

## 🔍 Role of Threat Intelligence in SOC Operations

In a SOC environment, Threat Intelligence is used to:

- Enrich alerts generated by SIEMs
- Validate suspicious indicators
- Provide background on observed activity
- Support incident classification and escalation

Threat Intelligence **does not replace analysis**, but enhances it by adding context.

---

## 🧩 Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)

Common IOCs include:

- Malicious IP addresses
- Suspicious domains or URLs
- File hashes associated with malware
- Email sender infrastructure

Important considerations:
- IOCs have a **limited lifespan**
- Context matters more than presence alone
- False positives are common without correlation

---

## 🛠️ Common Threat Intelligence Sources

SOC analysts typically rely on a combination of:

- Open-source intelligence (OSINT)
- Vendor threat feeds
- Government and CERT advisories
- Community-driven platforms

Analysts must assess **source reliability and relevance** before acting on intelligence.

---

## 🔄 Threat Intelligence Lifecycle

A simplified Threat Intelligence lifecycle includes:

1. **Collection** – Gathering data from multiple sources
2. **Processing** – Normalizing and filtering information
3. **Analysis** – Adding context and relevance
4. **Dissemination** – Sharing intelligence with stakeholders
5. **Feedback** – Improving future intelligence based on outcomes

Understanding this lifecycle helps analysts consume intelligence effectively.

---

## 📝 Documentation and Usage

When using Threat Intelligence in investigations, analysts should document:

- Source of the intelligence
- Confidence level
- How it influenced the investigation
- Any actions taken based on it

This ensures transparency and supports future analysis.

---

## 📌 Key Takeaway

Threat Intelligence is most effective when it is:

- Contextual
- Timely
- Actionable
- Integrated into SOC workflows

Used correctly, it significantly enhances detection, investigation, and response capabilities.
