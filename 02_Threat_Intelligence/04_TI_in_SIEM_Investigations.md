# Using Threat Intelligence in SIEM Investigations

Threat Intelligence is most powerful when **integrated directly into SIEM workflows**, enhancing alert context and investigation speed.

---

## 🔍 Enriching SIEM Alerts

Threat Intelligence can:

- Add reputation context to IPs, domains, and hashes
- Reduce investigation time
- Improve analyst confidence in decisions
- Support escalation and containment actions

---

## 🧩 Correlation and Context

Effective SIEM investigations combine:

- Internal telemetry
- Threat Intelligence enrichment
- Behavioral analysis
- Historical activity

Intelligence alone is insufficient without correlation.

---

## ⏱️ Operational Considerations

SOC analysts should:

- Avoid over-trusting enrichment results
- Understand source confidence levels
- Document how intelligence influenced decisions

---

## 📌 Key Takeaway

Threat Intelligence should **support**, not replace, analyst judgment in SIEM investigations.
