# Mapping Threat Intelligence to MITRE ATT&CK

The **MITRE ATT&CK framework** provides a structured way to describe adversary behavior. Mapping Threat Intelligence to ATT&CK techniques helps SOC analysts understand *how* an attacker operates, not just *what* indicators are used.

## 🎯 Why ATT&CK Mapping Matters

ATT&CK mapping allows analysts to:

- Add behavioral context to alerts
- Identify attacker objectives and progression
- Improve detection and response strategies
- Communicate findings using a common language

---

## 🧩 Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)

- **Tactics**: The adversary’s goal (e.g., Initial Access)
- **Techniques**: How the goal is achieved
- **Procedures**: Specific implementations

Threat Intelligence often references techniques rather than tools.

---

## 🔍 Using ATT&CK During Investigations

SOC analysts can:

- Map observed behavior to ATT&CK techniques
- Identify missing detection coverage
- Anticipate potential next steps of an attacker
- Support threat hunting activities

---

## 📝 Documentation Best Practices

When documenting ATT&CK mapping:

- Reference technique IDs (e.g., T1566)
- Explain observed behavior
- Avoid speculation without evidence

---

## 📌 Key Takeaway

ATT&CK mapping transforms Threat Intelligence from static data into **actionable defensive insight**.
