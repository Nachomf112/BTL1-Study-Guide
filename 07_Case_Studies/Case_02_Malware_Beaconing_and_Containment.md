# Case Study 02 – Malware Infection with Beaconing Activity

This case study simulates a **realistic SOC investigation** involving a suspected malware infection identified through **network beaconing behavior** and SIEM alerts.

The scenario demonstrates **log correlation, network analysis, and incident response**, aligned with BTL1 and real SOC workflows.

---

## 📌 Incident Summary

- **Incident Type:** Malware infection with command-and-control (C2) communication
- **Initial Detection Source:** SIEM alert (network anomaly)
- **SOC Role:** Tier 1 / Tier 2 Analyst
- **Status:** Confirmed security incident
- **Impact Level:** High

---

## ⏱️ Timeline Overview

| Time | Event |
|-----|------|
| 14:02 | SIEM generates outbound traffic anomaly alert |
| 14:10 | SOC begins investigation |
| 14:18 | Beaconing pattern identified |
| 14:30 | Endpoint identified as compromised |
| 14:45 | Incident escalated |
| 15:05 | Containment actions applied |

---

## 📊 Phase 1 – SIEM Alert Analysis

### Alert Details

- Repeated outbound connections at regular intervals
- Destination IP not previously observed
- Traffic over TCP port 443
- Low data volume per connection

### Initial Assessment

Traffic characteristics suggest **automated beaconing behavior**, commonly associated with malware C2 communication.

---

## 🌐 Phase 2 – Network Traffic Analysis

### Observations

- Connections every ~60 seconds
- Consistent packet size
- Encrypted traffic
- Destination hosted in high-risk region

### Interpretation

These indicators align with **command-and-control beaconing** patterns.

---

## 🧠 Phase 3 – Threat Intelligence Correlation

### Indicators Identified

- Destination IP address
- Associated domain (reverse lookup)

### Threat Intelligence Findings

- IP associated with known malware infrastructure
- Observed in recent campaigns targeting multiple sectors
- Medium-to-high confidence rating across sources

### MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

- **T1071.001 – Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols**
- **T1059 – Command and Scripting Interpreter (potential)**
- **T1105 – Ingress Tool Transfer (possible follow-on activity)**

---

## 💻 Phase 4 – Endpoint Investigation

### Endpoint Findings

- Suspicious process running under user context
- Executable located in user profile directory
- Persistence mechanism identified via startup entry

### Assessment

Endpoint confirmed as **compromised**.

---

## 🛡️ Phase 5 – Incident Response Actions

### Containment

- Endpoint isolated from network
- Malicious IP and domain blocked
- User account temporarily disabled

### Eradication

- Malware removed
- Persistence mechanism deleted
- System scanned and validated

### Recovery

- Endpoint reconnected after verification
- User credentials reset
- Monitoring enhanced

---

## 📝 Phase 6 – Reporting and Lessons Learned

### Incident Report Contents

- Incident overview and timeline
- IOCs and evidence
- Response actions
- Impact assessment

### Lessons Learned

- Improve endpoint monitoring
- Review egress traffic controls
- Enhance network anomaly detection

---

## 📌 Final Assessment

This case highlights the importance of:

- Detecting low-noise network anomalies
- Correlating SIEM and network data
- Rapid containment of compromised hosts
- Structured incident response processes
