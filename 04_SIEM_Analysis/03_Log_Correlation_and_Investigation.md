# Log Correlation and Investigation

Log correlation allows analysts to move from **isolated alerts** to **meaningful incident narratives**.

---

## 🔍 Why Correlation Is Essential

Single log events rarely provide full context. Correlation helps to:

- Identify attack chains
- Reconstruct timelines
- Reduce false positives
- Confirm malicious activity

---

## 🧩 Common Correlation Examples

- Multiple failed logins followed by a success
- Endpoint alert combined with network traffic
- Email phishing followed by suspicious authentication

---

## 🧠 Investigation Best Practices

Analysts should:

- Correlate across different data sources
- Focus on time-based relationships
- Validate findings with Threat Intelligence

---

## 📌 Key Takeaway

Correlation transforms raw logs into **actionable security insight**.
