# SIEM Analysis

Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platforms are a **central component of SOC operations**. They aggregate logs, generate alerts, and support detection, investigation, and response workflows.

This module focuses on **how SOC analysts use SIEMs in practice**, not on vendor-specific configurations.

## 🎯 Objectives of SIEM Analysis

The primary objectives of SIEM analysis are:

- Detect suspicious or malicious activity
- Investigate and validate alerts
- Correlate events across multiple data sources
- Support incident response and escalation
- Reduce false positives through contextual analysis

SIEM tools support analysts, but **human judgment remains essential**.

## 🧠 SOC Analyst Perspective

Effective SIEM analysis requires:

- Understanding what “normal” looks like
- Identifying anomalies and patterns
- Prioritizing alerts based on risk and impact
- Documenting findings clearly

This aligns closely with **Tier 1 and Tier 2 SOC roles**.
