# SIEM Fundamentals

A SIEM collects, normalizes, and analyzes logs from multiple sources to provide **centralized visibility** into security events.

## 🧩 Common SIEM Data Sources

Typical log sources include:

- Authentication systems
- Endpoints (EDR / OS logs)
- Network devices (firewalls, proxies)
- Servers and applications
- Email and cloud platforms

Understanding log sources is essential for investigation accuracy.

## 🧠 What SIEMs Do Well (and What They Don’t)

SIEMs excel at:
- Centralizing logs
- Correlating events
- Generating alerts

SIEMs do NOT:
- Automatically determine impact
- Replace analyst reasoning
- Eliminate false positives

---

## 📌 Key Takeaway

A SIEM is a **decision-support system**, not an automatic incident detector.
